# Breakout Game with Neuro Evolution of Augmented Topology (NEAT) AI

This project demonstrates the implementation of the classic game Breakout using the Pygame library and a Neuro Evolution of Augmented Topology (NEAT) AI algorithm. 
NEAT is a technique used to evolve artificial neural networks for various tasks, and in this case, it's being used to evolve an AI agent capable of playing Breakout.

# Project Structure
- main.py: Main script that runs the game and NEAT AI algorithm.
- config-feedforward: NEAT configuration file with parameters for the neural network evolution.


# Acknowledgments
This project is inspired by the concept of evolving neural networks to play classic games. 
The NEAT algorithm was introduced by Kenneth O. Stanley and Risto Miikkulainen in their paper "Evolving Neural Networks through Augmenting Topologies" (2002).
